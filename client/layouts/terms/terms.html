If the examinee has any historical background or prior knowledge of risk experienced then inform Care Buddy representative and medical practitioner before test about the same. Also if during any test, he/she experiences discomfort then should discontinue it. Recommendations regarding diet, exercise and lifestyle and medical advice provided in the dashboard are from expert panel consisting of highly experienced and skilled medical practitioners of the relevant field and are best option as per their opinion but these recommendations may or may not be beneficial to you and may cause or exacerbate certain medical problems. You are following these recommendations at your own risk. If at any time during the follow-up period you feel unwell or ill you should seek medical help immediately and discontinue Care Buddy recommendations. In addition, you could have a disease or condition even though your test results are in the normal range.
